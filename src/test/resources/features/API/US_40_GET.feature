  Scenario: When a GET request body containing valid authorization credentials is sent to
  the /api/profile/allAddressList endpoint, the returned status code should be validated as 200,
  and the message information in the response body should confirm as "success".

    * The api user constructs the base url with the "admin" token
    * The api user sets "api/profile/allAddressList" path parameters
    * The API user sends a GET request and records the response from the api refundReasonList endpoint.
    * The api user verifies that the status code is 200
    * The api user verifies that the message information in the response body is "success"

  with id (x) should be validated. This includes fields such as customer_id, name,email, phone, address,
  city, state, country, postal_code.

    * The api user sets "api/profile/allAddressList" path parameters
    * The api user prepares a GET request containing the  <id> for which details are to be accessed
    * The api user sends the "getbody" request and saves the "Response"
    * The api user validates the <id> <customer_id>  "<name>"  "<email>"  "<phone>" "<address>"  "<city>"  "<state>" "<country>" "<is_shipping_default>" "<is_billing_default>" "<created_at>" "<updated_at>" of the response body with index <dataindex>.
