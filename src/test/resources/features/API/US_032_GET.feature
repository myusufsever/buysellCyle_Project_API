Feature: As a user, I want to view the addresses in my profile via the API connection.

  Scenario: When a GET request body containing valid authorization information is sent to the /api/profile/address-list endpoint,
  the returned status code should be 200, and the message information in the response should be verified as "success".

    * The api user constructs the base url with the "customer" token
    * The api user sets "api/profile/address-list" path parameters
    * The api user sends the "get" request and saves the "Response"
    * The api user verifies that for "get" request type the status code is 200 and the message information in the response body is "success"

  Scenario Outline: When a GET request body containing valid authorization information is sent to the /api/profile/address-list endpoint,
  the response body for the address with ID 'x' should be verified to contain the following information:
  customer_id, name, email, phone, address, city, state, country, postal_code, is_shipping_default, is_billing_default, created_at, updated_at.

    * The api user constructs the base url with the "customer" token
    * The api user sets "api/profile/address-list" path parameters
    * The api user sends the "get" request and saves the "Response"
    * The api user validates the <id>, <customer_id>, "<name>", "<email>", "<phone>", "<address>", "<city>", "<state>", "<country>", <is_shipping_default>, <is_billing_default>, "<created_at>", "<updated_at>" of the response body with index <dataindex>.

    Examples:
      | id | customer_id  | name        | email                           | phone         | address                | city    | state   | country | is_shipping_default | is_billing_default | created_at                  | updated_at                   | dataindex  |
