  Scenario Outline: When a GET request body containing valid authorization information and the department ID
  to access detailed information is sent to the /api/departmentDetails endpoint,
  the returned status code should be 200, and the message information should be verified as "success".

    * The api user constructs the base url with the "admin" token
    * The api user sets "api/departmentDetails" path parameters
    * The api user prepares a GET request containing the refund reason <id> for which details are to be accessed, to send to the api refundReasonDetails endpoint.
    * The api user sends the "getbody" request and saves the "Response"
    * The api user verifies that for "getbody" request type the status code is 200 and the message information in the response body is "success"

    Examples:
      | id |
      | 1  |
