  Scenario Outline:When a POST request with valid authorization credentials and correct data (old_password, password, password_confirmation) is sent to the /api/change-password endpoint, the expected status code returned should be 200, and the message
  in the response body should confirm: "password change successfully".

    * The api user constructs the base url with the "customer" token

    * The api user sets "api/change-password" path parameters

    * The api user prepares a POST request containing the "<old_password>" "<password>" "<password_confirmation>" information to send to the api holidayAdd endpoint.

    * The api user sends the "post" request and saves the "Response"

    * The api user verifies that for "post" request type the status code is 200 and the message information in the response body is "password change successfully"

    Examples:
      | old_password | password         | password_confirmation       |
      | 123123123 | 12345678 | 12345678 |
