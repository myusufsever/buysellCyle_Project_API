  Scenario Outline: When a GET request body containing valid authorization information and
  the coupon ID to access details is sent to the /api/coupon/couponDetails endpoint, the returned status code should be 200, and the message information should be verified as "success".

    * The api user constructs the base url with the "admin" token
    * The api user sets "api/coupon/couponDetails" path parameters
    * The api user prepares a GET request containing the  <id> for which details are to be accessed
    * The api user sends the "getbody" request and saves the "Response"
    * The api user verifies that the status code is 200
    * The api user verifies that the message information in the response body is "success"

    Examples:
      | id |
      | 20 |
