  @simge331
  Scenario Outline:  When a valid GET request containing the address ID data that is intended to access detailed information is sent to the /api/profile/customerDetailsAddress endpoint with valid authorization credentials,
  the returned status code should be 200, and the message in the response should be verified as "success".

    * The api user constructs the base url with the "customer" token
    * The api user sets "api/profile/customerDetailsAddress" path parameters
    * The api user prepares a GET request containing the <id> information to send to the api endpoint
    * The api user sends the "getbody" request and saves the "Response"
    * The api user verifies that for "getbody" request type the status code is 200 and the message information in the response body is "success"
    Examples:
      |id |
      |373|
