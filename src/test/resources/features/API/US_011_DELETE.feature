Feature: As an administrator, I want to be able to delete Refund&Reason information with the specified ID number
  via the API connection.


  @[US_011-TC_001]
  Scenario Outline: When a DELETE request containing valid authorization credentials and the holiday id to be deleted is sent to the /api/holidayDelete endpoint, the expected status code returned should be 202, and the message
  in the response body should confirm: "holiday deleted successfully".

    * The api user constructs the base url with the "admin" token

    * The api user sets "api/holidayDelete" path parameters

    * The api user prepares a GET request containing the  <id> for which details are to be accessed

    * The api user sends the DELETE request and saves the response returned from the api refundReasonDelete endpoint.

    * The api user verifies that the status code is 202

    * The api user verifies that the message information in the response body is "holiday deleted successfully"

    * The api user verifies that the Deleted id information in the response body is the same as the id information in the request body.

    Examples:
      | id |
      | 56 |
