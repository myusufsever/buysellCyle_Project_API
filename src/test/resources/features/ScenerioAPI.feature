#  Getting the List of All FAQs
  Scenario: When a GET request with valid authorization information is sent to the /api/faqList endpoint the returned status code should be verified as 200, and the message in the response body should be verified as "success".
    * The api user constructs the base url with the "admin" token
    * The api user sets "api/faqsList" path parameters
    * The api user sends the "get" request and saves the "response"
    * The api user verifies that for "get" request type the status code is 200 and the message information in the response body is "success"
#  Creating a new FAQ

#  Verifying of Creation a new FAQ
  Scenario: The creation of the new FAQ record via the API should be verified through the API itself by sending a GET request to the /api/faqsDetails endpoint with the added_item_id returned in the response body.
    * The api user constructs the base url with the "admin" token
    * The api user sets "api/faqsDetails" path parameters
    * The api user adds a key field "id" with the value "added_item_id" to the request body
    * The api user sends the "getbody" request and saves the "Response"
    * The api user verifies that "added_item_id" returned in the response body by sending a GET request to the "faqsDetails" endpoint
#  Updating FAQs
  Scenario Outline: When a PATCH request containing valid authorization credentials, the FAQ id to be updated, and the updated information of the FAQ (title, description) is sent to the /api/faqsUpdate/{id} endpoint, the expected status code returned should be 202, and the message in the response body should confirm: "faqs updated successfully".
